Flutter MovieDB app
=====================================

![Sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/myotive/flutter_movie_db/master/screenshots/sample.gif)

This is a sample project I have been playing around with while learning flutter. Pull Requests welcome ;)

To get started, please register an account with TheMovieDb and obtain an API key:
https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction

Once you have your API key, modify the config file located in [`./lib/config.dart`](https://github.com/myotive/flutter_movie_db/blob/master/lib/config.dart).
